description: Set up a Striver problem (SDE / A2Z / any sheet under Take-U-Forward-DSA) and guide the user through solving it without giving the solution

# Solve a Striver Problem

## Arguments
- `<problem-name>`: Name of the problem (e.g., "Set Matrix Zeroes", "Next Permutation")
- `<sheet/topic>`: Sheet + topic directory, relative to repo root (e.g., `"Striver's SDE Sheet/Arrays"`, `"Striver's A2Z Sheet/Step 3 - Arrays/Medium"`)

If the second arg is omitted, ask the user which sheet they're working on before proceeding.

## Workflow

1. **Fetch the problem statement** — use WebSearch to look up the exact problem on takeuforward.org / LeetCode / GeeksforGeeks. Extract:
   - Problem description
   - All examples with input/output
   - Constraints

   If web search fails, ask the user to paste the problem statement. NEVER guess from memory.

2. **Create the solution file** at `<sheet/topic>/<problemNameCamelCase>.py` (e.g., `Striver's SDE Sheet/Arrays/setMatrixZeroes.py`) with the question comment block at the top followed by the notes template:

```python
# QUESTION: <Problem Name>
# <problem description line 1>
# <problem description line 2>
# ...
# Example 1:
# Input: ...
# Output: ...
#
# Constraints:
# ...

"""
#Brute Force:
1.
TC -> O(), SC -> O()

#Better Approach:
1.
TC -> O(), SC -> O()

#Optimal Approach:
1.
TC -> O(), SC -> O()

#KEY INSIGHT:
-
"""


class Solution:
    def <name>_brute(self) -> None:
        pass

    def <name>_better(self) -> None:
        pass

    def <name>_optimal(self) -> None:
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    # sol.<name>_optimal(...)
```

   Approaches are methods of `class Solution`; shared helpers are also methods, called via `self.<helper>(...)`. (This is the `Striver's SDE Sheet/` convention. The `Striver's A2Z Sheet/` is also class-based but names its methods `findSolution`/`findSolution1`/… — match whichever sheet the file lives in.)

   The `# QUESTION:` block is the single source of truth for problem text — it syncs to the sheet's tracker UI via that sheet's `sync_notes.py` (when present).

3. **Present the problem** to the user from the fetched data (description, examples, constraints).

4. **Guide without solving:**
   - Ask the user what their first instinct is
   - If they're stuck, give a **hint** (e.g., "Think about what data structure lets you do O(1) lookups")
   - If they propose an approach, confirm if it's correct and ask about the complexity
   - Nudge toward better approaches with questions, not answers (e.g., "Can you do better than O(n^2)? What if you sorted first?")
   - NEVER write the solution code — the user must write it themselves

5. **After the user writes their solution:**
   - Run checks: `python3 -m ruff format <file>` && `python3 -m ruff check <file>` && `python3 -m mypy <file>`
   - Fix any lint/type issues together
   - Ask the user to fill in the notes template with the approaches they considered

6. **Do NOT:**
   - Write or complete the solution function
   - Give away the optimal approach directly
   - Skip ahead if the user hasn't attempted it yet
